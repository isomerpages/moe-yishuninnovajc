### **Education & Career Guidance**
Against the backdrop of a more dynamic work landscape with new emerging jobs, the college recognises the need to provide education career guidance for our students to help them identify suitable career pathways that are in line with their strengths, interests and values. YIJCâ€™s ECG programme seeks to support our students in making more informed decisions that will bring them closer to their career goals. The ECG programme will also be differentiated based on the needs and readiness levels of the students. Through our ECG programme, we aim to expose our students to a wide range of careers, provide timely and accurate information about further education and develop workplace readiness skills in our students.
