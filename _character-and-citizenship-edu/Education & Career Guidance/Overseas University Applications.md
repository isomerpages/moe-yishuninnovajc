### **Overseas University Applications**
#### **General application overview**
**Important information**
* Most applications to US universities have to be made on the Common Apps platform, while applications to UK universities have to be made on the UCAS platform. See sub-sections (2) and (3) below for more information on applications to US and UK universities respectively.
* The application deadlines are usually in early January (next year). This means that current JC2 students will need to request for **predicted grades**, as your A Level results will not be ready yet. Request for your predicted grades can be made between **18 Aug 2025 – 30 Sep 2025**. You can make a request via this [online form](https://form.gov.sg/66f6346b362d593ca47439ad).
* Both UK and US universities require a personal statement and recommendation letter(s) from your tutors.

_Personal statement_: Admissions offices in the UK and the US expect to see different things in the personal statement. Follow [the link here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-f5QMPR5gPmm3KSfn8KijHDo37eItFkx) (login to Student ICON email account) to find out more about how you can write an impressive personal statement for the universities you are applying to!

_Recommendation letter_: Do make the request for the recommendation letter early (at least 3-4 weeks before the deadline), so that your tutor has enough time to write a good letter for you. Do inform them on how the letter should be submitted either on Common Apps or directly to the university.

**Other Documents**

_Enrolment letter_: If your university requires an enrolment letter as proof of your enrolment to Yishun Innova JC, please email the general office at yijc@moe.edu.sg to request for one.

_School transcript_: If your university requires you to submit a school transcript detailing the grades of your major examinations in Yishun Innova Junior College, please fill out this [form] (https://form.gov.sg/6821b8f054b570db3346ad48) to request for one. Do note that the transcript will be sent to the university directly and it will not be given to you.
