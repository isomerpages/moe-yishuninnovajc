### **Overseas University Applications**
#### **General application overview**
**Important information**
* Most applications to US universities have to be made on the Common App platform, while applications to UK universities have to be made on the UCAS platform. See sub-sections (2) and (3) below for more information on applications to US and UK universities respectively.
* The application deadlines are usually in early January (next year). This means that current JC2 students will need to request for **predicted grades**, as your A Level results will not be ready yet. Request for your predicted grades can be made between **14 Aug 2023 – 30 Sep 2023**. You can make a request via this [online form](https://form.gov.sg/60d571a0087ea00011b4114f).
* Both UK and US universities require a personal statement and recommendation letter(s) from your tutors.

_Personal statement_: Admissions offices in the UK and the US expect to see different things in the personal statement. Follow [the link here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-f5QMPR5gPmm3KSfn8KijHDo37eItFkx) (login to Student ICON email account) to find out more about how you can write an impressive personal statement for the universities you are applying to!

_Recommendation letter_: Do make the request for the recommendation letter early (at least 3-4 weeks before the deadline), so that your tutor has enough time to write a good letter for you.

#### **Applying to US Universities**
**How do I apply?**

Application to most US universities will be made via the [Common Application (Common App)](https://www.commonapp.org/). You can start filling out your application now.

You may find a step-by-step guide to completing the Common App application [here](https://www.commonapp.org/apply/first-year-students).

Please scan your:
* ‘O’ level result certificate
* JC1 and JC2 result slips

Please note that the college counsellor testimonial needs to be filled up by your CT.

**Application deadline**

Deadlines vary from university to university, and you will need to check the university website for the specific deadlines.

**Admission tests**

As a result of ongoing COVID-19 restrictions leading to limited testing availability for both SAT and the ACT, universities across the US have made the SAT/ACT optional. Please visit the following [link](https://www.ivywise.com/blog/colleges-going-test-optional/#:~:text=Cornell%20University%20and%20Columbia%20University,the%202021%2D22%20admissions%20cycle.) for more information on the universities that have made the tests optional.
