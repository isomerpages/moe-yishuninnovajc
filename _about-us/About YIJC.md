Every student has the potential to rise to every challenge in this complex and changing world. This belief drives us to empower our students into **future-ready leaders** and **life-long learners**, guided by the values of **H**umanity, **I**ntegrity, **C**larity, **A**gility and **P**ursuit of **E**xcellence. We challenge our students to open their minds, hearts and future to the infinite possibilities they can achieve.  
  
**To be life-long learners,** we equip our students with critical thinking and collaborative skills. These skills enable them to consider multiple perspectives and complexities of issues as they transform challenges into opportunities in a dynamic world.  
  
**To be future-ready leaders**, we equip them with workplace readiness, digital literacy and cross-cultural competencies to thrive in an evolving globalised and digital future. It is now more important than ever for our students to be digitally literate and to also possess an understanding of Digital Anthropology, which can be seen as the impact of technology on human societies and the challenges and opportunities that abound as a result. At YIJC, digital literacy is our niche and we aim to inculcate in students competencies through our Digital Literacies Programme which focuses on human-digital interactions in three distinct domains – digital productivity, citizenship and innovation, in line with our vision of developing future-ready leaders.  
  
With a team of caring teachers and active partnership with parents, we embrace all students and provide opportunities for all. Our students are our pride and part of our school’s journey. With courage they will rise and lean into their future like a blazing flame, Y.I.
