Welcome to Yishun Innova Junior College (YIJC), where we empower students to thrive as future-ready leaders and lifelong learners.

We believe our students possess limitless potential and that the VUCA world, characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, presents challenges and opportunities. At YIJC, we embrace this reality, equipping our students with the skills to navigate the VUCA world with confidence and resilience and to thrive amidst the ever-changing landscape.

Through the myriad of curricular and co-curricular opportunities, students hone their critical thinking and collaboration skills, and become agile learners and resilient leaders. In particular, digital literacy is a key focus at YIJC. Our Digital Literacies Programme prepares students to navigate the digital realm effectively while understanding the profound impact of technology on society.

With a dedicated team of teachers and strong partnerships with parents and the wider community, we create a nurturing environment where every student can flourish. As students embark on their journeys at YIJC, they will not only gain knowledge but also develop a mindset of lifelong learning and resilience. 

To prospective students, we look forward to having you journey with us. 
We are confident that you will rise to every challenge, igniting your future like a blazing flame.

**Aude Exaurare!**

Sincerely,

Michael de Silva<br>
Principal<br>
