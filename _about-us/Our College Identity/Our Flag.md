### **Our Flag**

<img src="/images/About Us/schoolflag.png">

#### **Symbolism**
The blazing flame of the College Crest against a pixelated background symbolises an envisioned bright future with passion and zeal, juxtaposed with a future that is for YIJCians to define. The sparks of the flame pixelate to transform into an asymmetrical star which represents our forward-looking aspiration to nurture students who will be able to thrive in the VUCA future. The bold heart of the flame centralised within the flag symbolises the steadfast commitment of the college to uphold its vision, mission, and core values.

*The flag was refreshed in 2023, on the 5th College Anniversary, with a new background while retaining the College Crest unchanged in the centre. The symbolism of these changes reflects the collegeâ€™s unwavering commitment to our values amidst a changing operating context to develop our students to thrive in the VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) world.
