### **Our Flag**

#### **Symbolism**
The blazing flame of the College Crest against a pixelated background symbolises an envisioned bright future with passion and zeal, juxtaposed with a future that is for YIJCians to define. The sparks of the flame pixelate to transform into an asymmetrical star which represents our forward-looking aspiration to nurture students who will be able to thrive in the VUCA future. The bold heart of the flame centralised within the flag symbolises the steadfast commitment of the college to uphold its vision, mission, and core values.
