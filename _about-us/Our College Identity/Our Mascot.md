<p>Introducing <strong>SPARKYI</strong>, the fiery and vibrant mascot of Yishun
Innova Junior College!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crafted in the shape of a torch radiating with a blazing flame, <strong>SPARKYI</strong> is
a beacon, symbolising the collective aspirations and achievements&nbsp;
and embodying the passion and zeal of our students and staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The name, <strong>SPARKYI</strong>, is derived from the initials of the
5 houses (SPARK) as well as the college (YI). This name aptly reflects
the intricate design of its body adorned with stars and flame symbols.
These elements represent the collegeâ€™s commitment to nurture students to
thrive in the VUCA future. Additionally, the integration of the house colours
serves as a symbol of the unity and camaraderie of the college community.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>SPARKYI</strong> ignites a blaze of enthusiasm, inspiring each and every one of our students to shine brightly and carry the torch of YIJC forward.</h4>
