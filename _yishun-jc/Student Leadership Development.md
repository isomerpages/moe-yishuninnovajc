### **Student Leadership Development**

<img src="/images/yishunjc4.jpg" style="width:60%;">

The YJC RaDiAL framework was created in 2009 to guide the leadership development efforts of the college. The college believes that every student is a student leader and sees leadership development as an integral part of character education. The blueprint for nurturing all students to be “global-ready leaders” is encapsulated in the YJC RaDiAL Framework. The YJC RaDiAL Framework guides student leadership development in the formal and non-formal curriculum: which includes the co-curricular programme, overseas service learning and immersion trips, and student work attachment. This framework aims to impart skills and competencies to prepare students as future leaders in their respective fields.
