### **The Co Curricular Programme**

The Co-curricular programme at YJC was designed to promote physical fitness, develop motor skills, instil knowledge and understanding of rules, concepts, and strategies of games and to teach students to work as teams in a variety of recreational and competitive activities. Niche cohort programmes like King of the Streets (JC1) and King of the Arena (JC2) have provided student leaders with avenues to organise events for students and to display teamwork and strategic planning to outwit and outplay one another in fitness challenges and street games respectively at the intra-college level. In the college’s history, sports like rugby, floorball and wushu have done the college proud at ‘A’ Division competitions.
