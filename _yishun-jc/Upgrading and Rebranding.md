### **Upgrading and Rebranding**

<img src="/images/yishunjc6.jpg" style="width:60%;">

Since 1999, the college has undergone a series of upgrading processes that have enhanced the learning environment of our students. In 2003, Project Unify was born to refine and standardise the interpretations of the school crest. To complement the new crest, the college uniform was revised from a yellow and grey ensemble to smart white and blue coordinates with a maroon trimming. In addition, a flexi-subject combination, including Music and Art, was introduced to give students the opportunity to pursue subjects they have a passion for. In 2004, YJC embarked on a branding journey which aimed to transform the college’s image and put forth a fresher and more vibrant presence. Hence, the tagline “Challenging the Mind, Touching the Spirit” was born to encapsulate the new image.
