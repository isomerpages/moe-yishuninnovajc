In YJC, the arts groups have played an instrumental role in nurturing talents and balanced individuals. At national platforms, students have showcased their talents at the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging successfully. There were also in-house performances like Wednesday Expresso to express passion in dance, singing and instrumental items. YJC took great pride in its numerous performances, always playing to a full house. Among them were “A Streetcar Named Desire”,“Anthony and Cleopatra” and “Lim Nee Soon.” Arts Fusion, a showcase to celebrate the artistic talents of the students, has been a perennial favourite among students and alumni. YJcians also showed prowess in debates, winning not just the inter-JC Malay and Tamil debates but also the SBC Pre-University Debate in 1989 and 1991.
