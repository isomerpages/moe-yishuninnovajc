Yishun Junior College was started in 1986. It was named after Mr Lim Nee Soon, who in the 1920s was the king of the rubber industry in Singapore. In Chinese, "Yi" means "high morals and principles" and "Shun" means "not hindered by obstacles". The college takes this name for these reasons and because of the pioneering spirit of Mr Lim. The architectural design of the college blends, in the words of the architect Meng Ta-Cheng, "Today's technology and yesterday's traditions" within a rustic setting. The college motto, “Florescat Concordia” is a Latin phrase meaning “Let Harmony Abound”.  The college song was written by its first principal, Mr Francis Wu.
