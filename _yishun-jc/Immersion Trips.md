At YJC, it is the belief of the college to inculcate and prepare our students with 21st century skills to be global citizens while remaining rooted to Singapore. As such, immersion experiences which are structured trips to international locations, exposes our students to the political, social, economic and cultural issues pertaining to the country while allowing them to experience unique cultures and environments. Students engage in community service activities, participate in experiential learning opportunities and school exchanges and are also given opportunities to develop their leadership abilities in planning, organising and implementing programmes. Over the years, the college has carried out immersion trips to China, India, Germany, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
