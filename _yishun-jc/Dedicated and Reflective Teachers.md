The passionate and dedicated teachers were YJCâ€™s pillar of support and greatest asset. Successfully nurturing batches of YJCians, their focus on the unique strengths of each child made students feel valued. The always reflective teachers displayed great commitment and camaraderie to attain breakthroughs and heighten engagement in teaching and learning. The ground breakers among them also took bold steps in seeking the best opportunities to help students reach their full potential, attested to by the Thinking Culture Award, Science Inquiry Curriculum, among many others. The teachers were unified in doing their best to provide a meaningful school experience that inculcates sound values, help students excel academically and equip them to be righteous leaders.
