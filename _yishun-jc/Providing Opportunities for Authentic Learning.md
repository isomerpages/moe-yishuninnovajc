### **Providing Opportunities for Authentic Learning**

True to YJC’s mission of achieving academic excellence, the emphasis on real world application intensified alongside its growth as a centre of learning. Since 1988, YJC’s Pre-University Seminar on Tamil Language and Literature provided a national platform to engage on issues covering Tamil culture, language, education and community. Since 2008, YJC’s China Studies Seminar has facilitated the sharing of resources and engagement with experts. The Global Perspective Symposium, a holistic initiation into JC education, equipped students with 21stC competencies. While the Maths Trail challenged students to apply concepts via experiential learning, the Mathematics and Science Quiz promoted lateral thinking skills and developed powers of observation.
