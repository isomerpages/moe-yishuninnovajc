### **The Character and Citizenship Education Programme**

YJCâ€™s celebration of its core values developed from CIP-driven fund-raising for needy students and assisting homes for the elderly, to a dedicated day for values in action, Celebrating Values Day (CVD). Collaborating with the Home Team and MINDEF, beneficiaries included MINDS, SAVH and neighbourhood community centres. To further help students develop empathy, compassion and a spirit of helping the less fortunate, the Overseas Service Learning programme has seen students venture to Nepal, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. National Day, Racial Harmony Day and Total Defence Day also infused community engagement and values inculcation. Through the Work Attachment Programme, students not only understood the workings of successful organisations but also internalised the highly-valued non-academic qualities.
