Across three decades, YJC’s six principals have strongly advocated a student-focused, holistic and values-driven education. Mr Francis Wu set the tone for academic excellence and total development. With Mr Mohamed Said’s emphasis on balanced education, the college did well in developing students holistically. Mrs Choy Say Chin focused on preparing the students for the new millennium while Mrs Ng-Gan Lay Choo re-positioned YJC as the college of choice where teaching and learning broke new boundaries. Mdm Koh Teck Siew’s philosophy was to anticipate the future so programmes were aligned to elicit 21stC competencies. Mrs Edelweis Neo, with her heart strongly for the students and their well-being, pushed for professional development emphasising greater student engagement and care. All these, with no less emphasis on character and leadership development.
