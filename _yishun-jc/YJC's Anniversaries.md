### **YJC's Anniversaries**

<img src="/images/yishunjc10.jpg" style="width:60%;">

Anniversary celebrations have been an important platform to capture the collegeâ€™s milestones and to provide a platform for alumni to connect with one another and their alma mater. The college celebrated its 10th anniversary in 1996 with a celebratory dinner and a commemoration publication. In 2006 and 2011, YJC commemorated its 20th and 25th anniversaries respectively by organising a series of meaningful events that culminated into a gala dinner on both occasions. The college commemorated its 30th anniversary by publishing a book with paintings contributed by alumni, current students and staff on any topic related to Singapore, as part of the SG50 celebrations. These anniversary celebrations have indeed brought back fond memories for staff and students alike, binding ties and forming life-long connections.
