### **Internationalisation & Cross Cultural Programme**
The YIJC Internationalisation and Cross-Cultural Programme provides student with experiences to augment their awareness of local and global concerns, and develop cross-cultural skills that will enable them to navigate an increasingly inter-connected world. As they embark on local learning journeys, Values In Action activities, and College programmes, students will have opportunities to take part in cultural activities, interact with people from various cultural backgrounds, and engage in discussions on local, regional, and international issues. Before international school trips are approved, the College will look into cultural exchange opportunities for students to broaden their understanding of the world through online interactions with overseas institutes.
