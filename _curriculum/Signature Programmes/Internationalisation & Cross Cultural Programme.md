<h3><strong>Internationalisation &amp; Cross Cultural Programme</strong></h3><p>To develop YIJCians in 21CC, the college strives to provide international and cross-cultural opportunities that will allow students to develop a cultural appreciation of Asia and the ability to communicate with peers from different cultural backgrounds. Beyond cultural events organised by the Mother Tongue Department and the commemoration of International Friendship Day and Racial Harmony Day, the college creates opportunities for students to interact with peers from other countries by hosting events, online interactions, and overseas trips. In 2023, we hosted a Waseda Shibuya High School where YIJCians buddied up with their Japanese counterparts so that they could experience a day in the life of a YIJCian, culminating in Raya Alive, organised by MLEP. The Japanese students presented some cultural information during morning assembly and there were rich cross-cultural interactions throughout the programme. In January, the college will host Mirae High School (South Korea).</p><p><strong>Global Learning Exchange Programme</strong></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="GLEP Presentation" src="/images/GLEP_Presentation.jpg"></div><p>Another key cross-cultural programme is the Global Learning &amp; Exchange Programme is a hybrid internationalisation programme by the CCE Committee that is open to all JC1 students to develop in them a global mindset through an awareness of local and global concerns, and cross-cultural skills that will enable them to navigate an inter-connected diverse world based on values of humanity and concern for the community. Through this programme, students will have opportunities to lead and take part in cultural activities, interact with people from various cultural backgrounds, and engage in discussions on local, regional, and international issues. In Nov 2023, our students interacted with students from Lao Cai High School for Gifted Students (Vietnam) and Prestige Education (Myanmar). In preparation for this event, the students also went on a learning journey to Botanic Gardens with Waseda Shibuya High School.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="2023 SLEP" src="/images/2023SLEP17.jpeg"></div><p>There were also two overseas trips in Nov 2023, the Humanities Trip to Vietnam and Student Leadership to Hong Kong. Students were able to immerse themselves in the cultures of the host countries and learn through authentic interactions and experiences to achieve a greater appreciation of Asia and the learning objectives of their respective trips.</p>
