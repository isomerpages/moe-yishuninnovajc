### **Resilience-Building Programme**
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 

Here at YIJC, we believe that one of the best ways to prepare our students for the future is to build their ability to bounce back from situations of adversity and vulnerability. Our Resilience-Building Programme aims to do just that. It consists of a series of lessons and workshops that allows students to better embrace and develop a Growth Mindset. Students are introduced to ways to develop confidence and adaptability, and general mental well-being is also promoted.

Our workshops and lessons are designed to facilitate in-depth conversations about resilience and what it entails. Through the use of case studies and real-life scenarios, our students learn about issues that teenagers and young adults typically face. Our students also collaboratively explore different options when problem solving. Such authentic discussions, facilitated by teachers, allow students to have open and honest dialogue about matters that affect them deeply and they have the opportunity to apply their learning. They also gain the support of their peers and teachers in coming up with approaches to overcome these issues. 

At YIJC, we believe in co-creating a supportive learning environment with our students _for our students_ . This Resilience-Building Programme and the conversation it generates about mental well-being, is but one way we demonstrate our heightened support for those under our care.
