### **Resilience-Building Programme**
Tough times never last, but tough people do.Â 

Here at YIJC, we believe that one of the best ways to prepare our students for the future is to build their ability to bounce back from situations of adversity and vulnerability. Our Resilience-Building Programme aims to do just that. It consists of a series of lessons and workshops that allows students to better embrace and develop a Growth Mindset. Students are introduced to ways to develop confidence and adaptability, and general mental well-being is also promoted.
