### **Talent Development Programme**
The College recognises the potential of higher achieving students and supports their development through the Talent Development Programme (TDP). Students who qualify for the programme will be given developmental opportunities in the areas of leadership, digital literacy, global awareness, as well as active citizenship. The programme also aims to enhance their personal effectiveness through personal branding, personal statement writing, and honing of interview and networking skills. Through the TDP, we help students to put their best foot forward for university and scholarship applications.

_Admission of JC1 students into the TDP is based on their L1R5 scores, and admission of JC2 students is based on their JC1 Promotional Examination results_

#### **TDP Interview Skills and Resume Writing Workshops**
The College organises an annual resume writing and interview skills workshop for the JC1 and JC2 TDP students to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to be able to handle scholarship and university admission interviews.

#### **Dialogue Sessions on Current Affairs**
You can also look forward to special just-in-time dialogue sessions organised for TDP students throughout the year. Aimed at providing further exposure to global and local current affairs, these sessions broaden your horizons and allow you to see the world from varying perspectives.
