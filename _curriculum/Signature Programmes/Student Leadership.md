Students are also developed holistically through mentoring and guidance from their teachers.</p><p>Along with cultivating a habit of deep reflection about their assignments, the student leadership experience here at YIJC creates positive&nbsp;<strong>Relationships</strong>&nbsp;that allow for more effective leadership development.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="stu leadership camp" src="/images/studentleadership1.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="sc camp" src="/images/studentleadership2.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Students Council Camp" src="/images/SC_Camp_1.jpg"></div><p><em>Students’ Council Camp: Building competencies through collaboration and camaraderie</em></p><h4><strong>Key Student Leadership Platforms</strong></h4><p>Student leaders are provided first-hand experience at planning, implementing, evaluating, and reviewing key College events.

This programme allows students to better appreciate the interconnectedness between the leadership domains of Intellectual Capacity, Teamwork, and Drive within an organisational context, and to apply their learning through a leadership assignment.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="SLEP" src="/images/studentleadership7.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Student Leadership EP 2023 to Hong Kong" src="/images/2023SLEP24.jpg"></div><p><em>Student Leadership Enrichment Programme</em></p>
