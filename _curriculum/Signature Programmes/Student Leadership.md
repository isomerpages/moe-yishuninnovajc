### **Student Leadership**
Here at YIJC, the Student Leadership Programme enhances leadership learning and further develops leadership competencies for all our students. The programme prepares every YIJC-ian to be responsible students of the College and responsible future citizens of our society.

Adopting a structured leadership developmental approach of Assignments-Relationships-Courses (A-R-C), the programme aims to develop student leaders in the domains of **Intellectual Capacity, Teamwork** and **Drive** .

**Courses** on leadership theories and philosophies provide deep understanding of leaders and leadership. Leadership **Assignments** offer hands-on opportunities to develop leadership competencies through programmes and activities. Students are also developed holistically through mentoring and guidance from their teachers. Along with cultivating a habit of deep reflection about their assignments, the student leadership experience here at YIJC creates positive **Relationships** that allow for more effective leadership development.
