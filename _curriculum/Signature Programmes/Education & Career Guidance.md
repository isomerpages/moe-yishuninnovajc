<h3><strong>Education &amp; Career Guidance</strong></h3><p>Against the backdrop of a more dynamic work landscape with new emerging jobs, the College recognises the need to provide Education and Career Guidance (ECG) for our students to help them identify suitable career pathways that are in line with their strengths, interests, and values. YIJCâ€™s ECG programme seeks to support our students in making more informed decisions that will bring them closer to their career goals.</p><p>The ECG programme is differentiated based on the needs and readiness levels of the students. Through our ECG programme, we aim to help our students identify their strengths and interests, and develop their aspirations by exposing them to a wide range of careers, providing ECG counselling, as well as timely and accurate information about further education. We also guide students in the necessary preparation for further education and hone workplace readiness skills to prepare them for the future.</p><p><strong>Our learning journeys to universities:</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="2" colspan="2"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ecg2.jpg"></div></th></tr><tr></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ecg1.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ecg3.jpg"></div><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h4><strong>YIJC Online Career Symposium</strong></h4><p>The college organises a Career Symposium every year in partnership with Advisory.sg.
