<p>YIJC aims to develop students for the real, beyond the time and space
of college, so that they can become Future-Ready Leaders and Lifelong Learners,
ready for the future and life. The college adopts an intentional approach
in developing students holistically, with an emphasis on values, E21CC,
and learning dispositions that will enable them to navigate the VUCA world
and embrace challenges as opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>This intentional development is done not just through classroom teaching
but through college-wide programmes that aim to make learning real for
YIJCians. One signature event is the<strong> Future-Ready Leaders, Lifelong Learners (FRLLLL) Week.</strong> 
</p>
<p>FRLLLL (pronounced “for real”) Week is a unique opportunity for Yishun
Innova JC students to step beyond the classroom and engage in experiential
learning that builds future-ready skills and lifelong growth. This week-long
program immerses students in real-world challenges, dynamic workshops,
and community involvement, empowering them to develop leadership qualities
and a mindset of continuous learning. FRLLLL Week is a transformative experience
that turns classroom learning into meaningful and authentic growth.</p>
<p>Our college is committed to offering diverse learning experiences to help
students discover their strengths and interests, nurturing well-rounded
individuals. FRLLLL Week includes a range of enriching activities—from
career symposiums and learning journeys for professional exposure to dialogues
with distinguished speakers and the ‘Sport as a Way of Life’ program. FRLLLL
Week prepares our students with skills they will carry beyond the classroom
and into real life.</p>
