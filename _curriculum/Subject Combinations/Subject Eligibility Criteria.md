<h3><strong>Subject Eligibility Criteria</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Subjects with pre-requisites or selection test</strong></h4>
<p><strong>H2 Computing: Pass Selection Test</strong>
</p>
<p>Note: Passing the selection tests are set requirements that students must
fulfil in order to offer the subject at the A-Level.</p>

</p>
<p><strong><u>Note:</u></strong>
<br>If a subject or subject combination is&nbsp;<strong>oversubscribed</strong>,
students will be selected based on&nbsp;<strong>academic merit</strong>.
(Please see section below on Merit Based Allocation)</p>
<h4><strong>Merit Based Allocation</strong></h4>
<p>If a subject or subject combination is oversubscribed, students will be
selected&nbsp;<strong>based on academic merit</strong>, including performance
in the relevant subject and L1R5 (excluding bonus points). Thus, the College
may not be able to offer a subject to all the students who opted for it.</p>
<h4><strong>Indicative Grade Profiles</strong></h4>
<p>Based on trend data, the College has compiled some&nbsp;<strong>indicative cut-off points</strong>&nbsp;in
the form of an&nbsp;<strong>Indicative Grade Profile</strong>&nbsp;to assist
students in making an informed choice for subjects with subject pre-requisites
or assumed knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicative grade profiles refers to the grades of students for their relevant
GCE O-Level subjects. They may vary over time, depending on the number
and grade performance of students, and the number of places available for
the subject. Meeting the indicative grade profile does not guarantee that
the student would be able to offer that subject.</p>

<h4><strong>University course pre-requisites</strong></h4>
<p>Your future career may require you to undertake certain degrees and/or
courses at the undergraduate level. In turn, these undergraduate courses
in the universities may or may not have course-specific subject pre-requisites.
As such, you are advised to check the minimum requirements and indicative
grade profiles from the university websites before making a decision on
the subject combination to offer.</p>
