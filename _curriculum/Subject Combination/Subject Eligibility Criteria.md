### **Subject Eligibility Criteria**
#### **Subjects with pre-requisites or selection test**

Note: Passing the selection tests are set requirements that students must fulfil in order to offer the subject at the A-Level.

#### **Subjects with assumed knowledge**

Refer to the SEAB Syllabus document for the assumed knowledge for O-Level subjects. [https://www.seab.gov.sg/](https://www.seab.gov.sg/)

Note:<br>
If a subject or subject combination is **oversubscribed**, students will be selected based on **academic merit**.<br>(see section on Merit Based Allocation)

#### **Merit Based Allocation**
If a subject or subject combination is oversubscribed, students will be selected **based on academic merit**, including performance in the relevant subject and L1R5 (excluding bonus points). Thus, the College may not be able to offer a subject to all the students who opted for it.

#### **Indicative Grade Profiles**
Based on trend data, the College has compiled some **indicative cut-off points** in the form of an **Indicative Grade Profile** to assist students in making an informed choice for subjects with subject pre-requisites or assumed knowledge. 

Indicative grade profiles refers to the grades of students for their relevant GCE O-Level subjects. They may vary over time, depending on the number and grade performance of students, and the number of places available for the subject. Meeting the indicative grade profile does not guarantee that the student would be able to offer that subject.

#### **University course pre-requisites**
Your future career may require you to undertake certain degrees and/or courses at the undergraduate level. In turn, these undergraduate courses in the universities may or may not have course-specific subject pre-requisites. As such, you are advised to check the minimum requirements and indicative grade profiles from the university websites before making a decision on the subject combination to offer.
