<p>As Vice-President of the 6<sup>th</sup> Students’ Council, Ang Kok Rui’s
legacy extends beyond well-run events and detailed proposals — he leaves
behind a spirit of optimism, resilience, and dedicated service to the YIJC
community. His story reflects the journey of a student who grew through
challenges, led with intention, and inspired with quiet confidence.</p>
<p>From the outset, Kok Rui approached academic life with discipline and
purpose. An organised and reflective individual, he often sought feedback
and was not afraid to seek help. He was selected to participate in the
prestigious 35<sup>th</sup> Singapore Chemistry Olympiad and earned the
Edusave Certificate of Academic Achievement in 2023, a nod to both his
academic ability and consistent effort. But what truly distinguished him
was his generosity: Kok Rui regularly supported struggling classmates,
offering academic help and steady moral support. His dependable presence
and willingness to uplift others earned him the respect from &nbsp;both
peers and teachers.</p>
<p>Kok Rui credits much of his academic and personal growth to the care and
dedication of his teachers. “They are really patient and very caring,”
he shared. “When we don’t understand certain concepts, they explain things
step-by-step, always making sure we understand thoroughly before moving
on.” He especially appreciated how accessible teachers were beyond class
hours, &nbsp;whether for academic guidance or encouragement during stressful
times.</p>
<p>One of Kok Rui’s most significant achievements in YIJC was spearheading
the 2024 JC1 Orientation — an event that showcased his leadership and organisational
abilities. “Everyone came together and forged strong camaraderie,” he recalled,
describing how the Students’ Council worked as one to deliver a meaningful
experience for the incoming students. In the face of tight timelines and
shifting logistics, Kok Rui stayed calm and remained focused on finding
solutions. His foresight in managing manpower and working closely with
various stakeholders ensured the event’s success, drawing praise from staff
and school leaders alike.</p>
<p>Whether supporting flagship events or working behind the scenes, Kok Rui
carried out his Students’ Council duties with diligence and dedication.
He honed his public speaking abilities, developed creative problem-solving
skills, and balanced his academic and leadership commitments with quiet
determination. To him, leadership was not about being in the spotlight
— it was about service, discipline, continuous learning and collective
growth.</p>
<p>Eager to explore life beyond junior college, Kok Rui made full use of
the opportunities offered through the college’s Talent Development Programme
(TDP). He participated in university and career exposure sessions, including
visits to the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological
University (NTU), and came away with a broadened view of the pathways ahead.
“The sessions broadened my perspective, showing &nbsp;me diverse options
I had not previously considered,” he reflected. “It made me realise the
importance of understanding my interests and thinking more deeply about
the causes that I care about.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Kok Rui is considering pursuing either Pharmacy or Chemistry
at NUS —choices that reflect his passion for the sciences and desire to
deepen his knowledge in Chemistry, a subject he grew to love during his
time in YIJC.</p>
<p>To his juniors, Kok Rui offers this heartfelt advice: <em>“Pace yourself for the A-Level journey and treat it like a marathon. Don’t start fast and burn out. Take time to understand your learning style, and when you’re tired, take a break. Whether it’s going out to nature or spending time with someone you care about, small moments like these can help you recharge and go the distance.”</em>

<p>Kok Rui graduates from YIJC embodying the qualities of a thoughtful leader,
compassionate peer, and reflective learner — a young person of quiet strength
and purpose. We wish him every success in the journey ahead.</p>
