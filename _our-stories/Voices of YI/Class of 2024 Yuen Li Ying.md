<p>For Li Ying, success did not come from shortcuts or strokes of luck. It
was forged through determination, careful planning, and an openness to
grow through every challenge. A top performer in the 2024 GCE A-Level cohort,
Li Ying’s achievements reflect more than just academic capability — they
embody the resilience, adaptability, and commitment that define her junior
college experience.</p>
<p>Li Ying admits she felt unprepared at the start of JC1, often requiring
weekly consultations to catch up. “I really had a lot to work on,” she
shares candidly. Li Ying credits much of her academic success to her subject
tutors, who were passionate in teaching the subjects and who always encouraged
her, even in the face of academic fatigue and stress. One such tutor was
Ms Pearlyn Ong, her General Paper teacher, who taught her since JC1. “Ms
Ong never said no to a consult. Her gentle patience and support helped
give me the confidence to keep going.”</p>
<p>Her gratitude also extends to her Civics Tutor, Mr Steven Wong, who inspired
her passion for Chemistry and encouraged her to persevere through the demanding
H3 Chemistry curriculum. “I was on the fence about continuing H3 Chemistry,
but Mr Wong never stopped believing in me. I’m glad I followed through
— it paid off.”</p>
<p>Taking up H3 Chemistry was one of the many decisions that tested her limits.
With the added commute time and heavy coursework, Li Ying said that she
had to reconsider her approach to managing time. “I had to learn to be
efficient — even travel time became study time,” she recounts. That being
said, Li Ying emphasised the importance of balance: taking purposeful breaks
while maintaining clear priorities. No matter how busy school was, Li Ying
would usually keep her weekends for volunteering, rest, or spend time with
her loved ones.</p>
<p>She also credits her Mathematics teachers, Mr Joshua Kwan and Mr Jaymond
Tan, for making learning an enjoyable process. “They always asked us for
feedback and took our views seriously. That really helped me to better
understand what I was learning and allowed me to verbalise my needs,” she
reflects. Ms Irene Lim, her Biology teacher, made a lasting impression
through her meticulous guidance and attention to detail, especially during
the final stretch leading up to the A-Level examination.</p>
<p>Outside the classroom, Li Ying poured her energy into causes that mattered,
which helped developed her holistically. As a member of Interact Club,
Li Ying had the opportunity to facilitate several events and to interact
with a diverse range of people, from preschoolers to the elderly in the
community. One of her most meaningful projects was organising <em>Dining in the Dark,</em> held
in partnership with the Singapore Association Of The Visually Handicapped
(SAVH). The event offered participants a powerful, immersive experience
to better understand visual impairment. &nbsp;“It taught me a lot — not
just about leadership, but about empathy. I also learned how to step out
of my comfort zone and discovered a love for community service”.</p>
<p>Curiosity and a hunger to grow have always guided Li Ying’s learning choices.
One clear example was during the Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) project,
when she chose to learn Python programming independently. This new interest
led her to take part in the NUS Computing Course for A-Level graduates,
where she gained a deeper appreciation for the possibilities in technology.</p>
<p>She also took full advantage of opportunities provided by the college,
participating in programmes like the Pre-U Seminar and the Work Experience
Programme (WEP), which enhanced her communication, collaboration (edited
this to better reflect e21CC) and professional skills. At the Pre-U Seminar,
Li Ying collaborated with peers from other junior colleges and even led
a subcommittee, &nbsp;an experience that enhanced her confidence and ability
to articulate ideas effectively. . Her work experience at CT Art Creation,
a playground design and equipment provider, was just as eye-opening. She
developed &nbsp;an Excel tracking system to streamline their processes,
&nbsp;gaining valuable exposure to problem-solving in a real-world problem
setting.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her journey, Li Ying takes pride not only in her academic
achievements but also in her personal growth, made possible by the steadfast
support of those around her. ,</p>
<p>Her advice to juniors? <em>“Don’t give up. Even if you start late or feel unsure, keep your end goal in sight and do not forget why you started. Have the determination and courage to pursue excellence. Aim for the moon, so that even when you fall, you might land among the stars!”</em>
</p>
<p>Li Ying leaves college not only as a scholar, but as a changemaker — resilient,
reflective, and ready for &nbsp;future challenges. We wish her all the
very best.</p>
