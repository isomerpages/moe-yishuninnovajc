<p>To start the year off meaningfully, the college organised learning journeys
to 13 different faculties in the 6 autonomous universities on 9 January
2024. In these visits, various university representatives highlighted the
unique aspects of their degree programmes and provided insight on what
our students can expect as an undergraduate. For some faculties, students
had the opportunity to see and experience first-hand some of the equipment
that they will use for their undergraduate studies. This was followed by
a Further Education Symposium on 10 July, where local autonomous universities
such as NUS, NTU, SMU, SIT and SUSS were featured. Students had the opportunity
to ask questions and also received the latest updates and application advice
from faculty members and alumni who participated in the event.</p>
