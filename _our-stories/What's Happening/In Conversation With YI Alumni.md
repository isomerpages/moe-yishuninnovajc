<p><em>Our alumni speakers sharing about their journey in law.</em>
</p>
<p>On 3 Apr 2024, YIJC hosted our first In Conversation with Alumni session
â€“ where our alumni shared more on the realm of law, their journey in the
industry as well as the myriad pathways that a law degree can unlock. These
conversational sessions aim to provide YIJCians with a rich opportunity
to learn more about the varied potential pathways for their future.</p>
<p>Students who attended enjoyed the session tremendously and found the experiences
and insights of their four accomplished seniors deeply illuminating and
their advice for pursuing law at the postgraduate level very helpful.</p>
<p>YIJC would like to thank our alumni for making this happen!</p>
