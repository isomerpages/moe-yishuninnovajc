<p>The 2024 Orientation Theme, "<strong>Adventura - Explore, Experience, Evolve</strong>",
signifies an exciting journey for the new JC1 students to explore their
individual strengths and areas of growth, adapt to the new college environment
and forge meaningful connections with the college comunity. The theme "Adventura",
which refers to adventure in latin, serves to empower the JC1 students
as they embark on their whole new journey in the college.</p>
<p>Through the 5-day programme, the students received guidance regarding
various subject combinations and learnt about the array of college programmes
that are there to prepare them to be future-ready leaders and lifelong
learners. The bonding activities and games planned and organised by their
seniors, also allowed them to forge new friendships that will serve as
important pillars of support as they navigate their journey in the college.</p>
<p>The Orientation Finale featured an exhilarating out-of-school Amazing
Race and our exclusive Jam &amp; Hop event, culminating in an atmosphere
brimming with anticipation and excitement. The new JC1s were left eager
and ready for the adventures ahead. Forge ahead and conquer, JC1s!
