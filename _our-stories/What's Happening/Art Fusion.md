<p>Arts Fusion 2024 was a mega Arts Concert that featured students from the
Symphonic Band, the Chinese Orchestra, the Dance, the Chorale and the Drama
club. At this concert, each CCA celebrated their talent, passion and love
for the Arts. It was an evening where the Symphonic Band and Chinese Orchestra
majestically serenaded the crowd with their resplendent performances, while
the Choir entertained and charmed with their melodious musical renditions.
The Dance Club awed the crowd with their spectacular dance moves and the
Drama Club gave us all a taste of a homegrown script inspired by our very
own students.</p>
<p>More than 150 YIJCians performed for Arts Fusion 2024 and created special
memories for both themselves and the enraptured audience.</p>
