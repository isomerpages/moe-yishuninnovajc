<p>Our College believes that learning should not be confined to the classroom.
Given the increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world
that we live in today, the College recognises that there is a need to develop
the students continually and to expose them to diverse learning environments
so as to better prepare them for the future.</p>
<p>It is this mindset that drives the College to look for new opportunities
and platforms to develop our students and from 20 to 24 May 2024, we held
our inaugural <strong>Future-Ready Leaders, Lifelong Learners (FRLLLL) Week</strong> for
all JC1 students.</p>
<p>The week was packed with diverse and immersive activities, such as a Career
Symposium, a ChatGPT workshop, a Singapore Perspectives dialogue with an
ambassador from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as well as an external
Sports Education Programme. A significant highlight of the week was a cohort-wide
learning journey to various industries and organisations where our students
were able to see first-hand the relevance of their academic subjects and
21st Century competencies in an authentic work environment. They also had
the chance to interact with professionals to hear from their personal experiences
â€“ such as their successes and challenges faced, and gained more self-awareness
about their career interests in the process.</p>
