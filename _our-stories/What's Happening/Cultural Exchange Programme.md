<p>On 11th January 2024, Waseda Shibuya Senior High School hosted 22 of our
students, giving them the opportunity to experience a day in the life of
Japanese high school students and interacting with them throughout the
day. On 2nd May 2024, YIJC reciprocated by hosting 25 Japanese students
and 2 teachers from Waseda Shibuya Senior High School. The programme aimed
to create opportunities for cultural and social interactions among the
students and to allow the Japanese students to also have a taste of junior
college education.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights included a learning journey to the Religious Rehabilitation
Group, where our students learned about Singapore's efforts to correct
misinterpretations of religious concepts and dispel extremist and terrorist
ideologies among detainees. The programme concluded with a special Malay
cultural exchange segment organized by the YIJC Malay Language Elective
Project students, featuring booths showcasing Malay cuisine and cultural
activities.</p>
