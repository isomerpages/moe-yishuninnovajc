<p>In 2024, Yishun Innova Junior College (YIJC) hosted two exhilarating sporting
events that were pivotal in developing leadership competencies, promoting
health and safety, fostering strong student bonds, and encouraging an active
lifestyle. In each of these sporting events, students from different houses
and classes are brought together and have an opportunity to showcase their
athletic prowess and hone their collaborative skills.
<br>
<br>In the heart-pounding King of the Arena, class teams from the JC2 cohort
challenge their physical limits as they take on physically demanding challenges
such as flipping tyres, and intense tasks involving kettlebells and slam
balls. Meanwhile, the electrifying King of the Streets features fun street
versions of sports like Floorball, Frisbee, Tchoukball, Handball and many
more for the JC1 cohort.</p>
<p>As students engage in these varied sporting activities, they not only
showcase their athletic abilities but also develop crucial leadership skills.
Some played a vital role in organising and executing the events, gaining
agility and honing their mental clarity in the process, while others learned
how to better strategise, coordinate with their teammates and inspired
each other to pursue a spirit of excellence.
<br>
<br>Run by students, for students, King of the Streets and King of the Arena
ignite a spirit of unity and aims to nurture our students into holistic
and future-ready leaders.</p>
