<p>On 12th January 2024, our college hosted our second in-person Open House
post-COVID. This momentous occasion brought together every member of our
college community, who were unified by the common goal of showcasing YIJC's
exceptional offerings to inspire and nurture students into future-ready
leaders and lifelong learners.</p>
<p>At the heart of the event, our school leaders delivered two captivating
presentations that offered a comprehensive overview of our college, the
various post-secondary pathways available to students, highlighting the
numerous opportunities and possibilities that await them. After which,
they took time to address the questions posed by prospective parents and
students, ensuring that all doubts and concerns were clarified.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the Open House was the resplendent CCA showcase
and booths, which exhibited the students’ diverse talents. The incredible
array of skills and abilities on display truly exemplified the spirit of
excellence that defines our college. In addition, we also organised two
informative Students’ panels specifically catered to Arts and Science students.
This allowed us to cater to the unique interests of each group, offering
valuable insights to the various academic subjects, college programmes,
and the well-planned timetable. Our library was transformed into a hub
of knowledge with subject booths that addressed pressing questions related
to various academic disciplines. Overall, the event was a testament to
the passion and dedication of our staff, students, and faculty in nurturing
a community of motivated and talented individuals.</p>
