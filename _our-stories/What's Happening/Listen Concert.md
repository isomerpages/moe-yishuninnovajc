<p>‘Listen’ is a signature event that is organised by our very own Musicians’
Club, under the creative direction of their instructor, Mr. Redwan Hamzah.
It is a spectacular rocking concert featuring various Musicians' Club Bands
which are helmed by talented individuals, and it marks the culmination
of many hours of training, planning and coordination.</p>
<p>This event has a passionate following and in 2024, an audience of more
than 800 enjoyed an evening of amazing songs and music. It was an especially
special night where the hall transformed into a spectacle of sound and
light, and members of the bands became celebrities.</p>
