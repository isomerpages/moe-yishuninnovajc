### **For Parents**
#### **Beginning-of-Year JC1 Parent Engagement Talk (PET)**
This PET session will provide an overview of our College and expand on the academic and co-curricular journey your child will embark on. The session will also provide information that will help your child decide on his/her subject combination shortly after joining the College. We have invited our Education & Career Guidance (ECG) counsellor to speak at this PET and she will share various factors to consider when reviewing your child’s choices.
