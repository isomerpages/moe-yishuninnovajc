<p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Sagitar House" src="/images/Green__1_.png"></div><p><strong>Sagitar House</strong> is the House of the Wolves, embodying the spirit of strength and loyalty. Stronger together, the wolves of Sagitar are fiercely committed to their pack, caring for each other as a close family. Its name originates from a combination of Sagittarius, the constellation representing the influential centaur who mentored the great hero Achilles, and Seletar, a locality in Singapore named after the Orang Seletar, who were Malay sea gypsies living on the waters of the island. These two chosen names are integrated from the Green Houses of Innova and Yishun JCs.</p><p></p>
