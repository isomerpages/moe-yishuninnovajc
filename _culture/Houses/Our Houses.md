<p>Students of Yishun Innova Junior College are grouped into 5 houses. The names of the houses pay homage to former houses and are uniquely YIJC. Each house is led by a student body and is represented by its own animal mascot, colour and cheers.</p><p>The initials of the houses form the word ‘SPARK’ - representing the light and heat from the star and flame which are important symbols in the college logo. The houses aim to SPARK passion, team spirit and a sense of belonging through spirited competitions organised by various student leadership bodies throughout the year. The participants accumulate points for their houses to win the various competitions and the overall House Champion challenge trophy.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Images/SPARK__1_.jpg"></div><p></p>
