Everywhere they go, Peirseus’ foxes bring their enthusiasm and wit, building a stronger body for the whole group. The House of Peirseus carries the heritage from Yishun JC’s Peirce House, the reservoir named after Robert Peirce, Singapore’s Municipal Engineer from 1901 to 1916, and Perseus, the constellation named after the Greek god renowned for his intelligence and adventurous spirit. It is of little wonder that the colour Orange is chosen to represent the bright wit of the Peirseus House.</p><p></p>
