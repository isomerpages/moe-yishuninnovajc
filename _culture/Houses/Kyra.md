Righteous and relentless, the lions of Kyra embody the values of honour and integrity in all that they do. They develop others in their pride and help each other to do what is right. The name ‘Kyra’, was inspired by the constellation ‘Lyra’, which represents the Orpheus’ lyre. Kyra House is the Yellow House of Yishun Innova JC, inheriting the traditions of the Canberra and Rasalas Houses from Yishun and Innova JC respectively.</p>
