The panthers of Arius are resilient and dauntless, just like a hunter focused on its goal. Its name is a fusion of the Yishun JC House of ‘Admiralty’, a reminder that the nearby area was once a naval base operated by the British Admiralty. and Innova JC house of ‘Taurus’, the star cluster that represents the steadfast bull, melded together with ‘Ri’ from the Orion constellation, named after the skilful mythical hunter. The lively colour Red represents the Arius House, previously shared by Admiralty and Taurus in both Yishun and Innova JCs.</p>
