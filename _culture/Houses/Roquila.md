They are visionary and bold in their decisions and plans. The name Roquila carries the heritage of Rodney from Yishun JC, a local road in the vicinity of Yishun and Aquila from the Innova JC, named after the mighty Eagle constellation from Roman mythology that symbolised victory, came together to form ‘Roquila’. Blue is the colour of Roquila, as it represents the calm foresight the Eagles of Roquila embody.</p>
