#### **International Students Seeking Admission to YIJC**
International students with good academic results and active co-curricular involvement are welcome to apply to pursue a junior college education at Yishun Innova Junior College. The application period begins from end December to 15 Jan 2024. Admission is subject to availability of vacancies after JAE school posting.

International Students (IS) seeking admission to YIJC are required to sit for a centralised assessment (J-PACT - Junior College Principals Academy Certification Test) conducted by&nbsp;[Principals Academy Inc (PAI)](https://www.pai.sg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=105).&nbsp;

The J-PACT results only provide a benchmark for all international students seeking admission to junior colleges in Singapore and do not in any way guarantee a place in any junior college. For information about the J-PACT test schedule/fees, instructions, and other important notes for application, please visit the&nbsp;[J-PACT website](https://www.pai.sg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=104).&nbsp;
