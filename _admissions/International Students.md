#### **International Students Seeking Admission to YIJC**
International students with good academic results and active co-curricular involvement are welcome to apply to pursue a junior college education at Yishun Innova Junior College. The application period begins from end December to 13 Jan 2023. Admission is subject to availability of vacancies after JAE school posting.

The J-PACT results only provide a benchmark for all international students seeking admission to junior colleges in Singapore and do not in any way guarantee a place in any junior college.
