<h3><strong>Post JAE Appeal</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Post-JAE Appeal Exercise</strong></h4>
<p>Only students who meet the cut-off point (COP) for admission to Yishun
Innova Junior College (YIJC) can be considered for appeals. For 2025, the
net aggregate L1R5 COP for YIJC are: 18 (Science), 19* (Arts).</p>
<p>*The last posted student YIJC received for the Arts course had a net aggregate
score of 19. However, given that the college had vacancies after JAE posting
to the Arts course, the college would consider admitting a JC-eligible
student with L1R5 of 20, if there are available vacancies.</p>
<p>Eligible appeals will be given due consideration, subject to available
vacancies and the schoolâ€™s admission criteria.</p>
<p></p>
