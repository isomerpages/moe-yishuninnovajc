Innova Junior College made a spectacular arts debut with an original musical at the 2005 Ministry of Education Workplan Seminar. This marked the first of many original artistic endeavours that demonstrated the college’s commitment to enable all Innovians to pursue their aesthetic passions to the fullest. A signature event in the college’s arts scene was the Musicians’ Club concert where students’ musical talents were featured in unique, diverse bands. The Performing Arts CCAs were another platform for students to hone their artistic skills in rigorous training programmes. Their performances were highlights of major college events.
