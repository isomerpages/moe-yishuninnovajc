Innova Junior College was privileged to have been led by school leaders who capably drove the college towards achieving its vision and mission at each stage of the college’s development. Under the first principal, Ms Yeo Hong Mui, the college distinguished itself as institution that empowered Innovians to pursue a range of passions. Mrs Marian Chia built on this legacy, implementing a structured approach to the leadership development of all students. Her memorable mantra, ‘High Care, High Expectations, reflected each Innovian’s pursuit of excellence within a supportive environment. Mr Michael de Silva led the college through a process of re-envisioning, updating the college’s vision and mission to prepare students for an uncertain future. He also steered the college through the merger process, inspiring confidence amongst staff and students with his consultative approach and visionary leadership.
