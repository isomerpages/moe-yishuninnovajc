At Innova Junior College, studentsâ€™ learning was enhanced through a range of enrichment opportunities outside the classroom. Innovians participated in the Pre-University Seminar and the Plain English Speaking Award collaborating with and pitting themselves against their counterparts from various institutions. IJC was appointed as the 2nd centre for the Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) in 2006 for students to attain a higher level of proficiency and a deeper understanding of Malay Language and Literature. Cultural and language seminars, overseas immersion trips and literature camp and work attachment opportunities in relevant industries were key platforms for this programme.
