Innova Junior College’s sports programmes were instrumental in Innovians’ holistic development. The Physical Education (PE) department encouraged student-initiated CCAs. From the college’s inception in 2005, students enjoyed a wide range of CCAs: from cheerleading and entrepreneurship to wushu and taekwondo. The annual Sports Day, planned and led by house leaders, was a memorable event for friendly rivalry and a showcase of talents in sport as well as cheerleading and dance. In later years, Sports Day evolved into ‘Agon Nova’, an event that encouraged all students to participate in games of their choice, widening the platform for each Innovian to compete and experience the camaraderie that sport nurtures.
