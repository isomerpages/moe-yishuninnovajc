Innova Junior College aimed to nurture a strong sense of belonging to the nation in all Innovians by empowering each student to discover what Singapore means to them on a personal level using a multisensory approach. When Singapore celebrated her 50th birthday, the college organised a heritage trail around the Woodlands region themed ‘Woodlands: Our Heritage, Home, Hope’. The Racial Harmony Day Celebrations, too, allowed students to experience the customs, foods, and games of the different ethnic groups. These experiential learning journeys and celebrations were accompanied by rigorous discussions within the classroom to promote greater understanding of citizenship through teacher facilitation and student reflections on key national developments and future trends.
