Service to the community was a cherished and constant feature of the Innovian experience. Innovians demonstrated and cultivated compassion, humanity and leadership as they worked on a wide range of service projects. Each year, classes and CCA groups came together to select and embark on community service projects that were especially meaningful to them. The annual Lunar New Year Hamper Outreach is familiar to many generations of Innovians – no college Lunar New Year celebration was complete without distributing hampers to residents of the neighbouring blocks of flats. The annual Overseas Service Learning Expedition was another hallmark of IJC’s tradition of service. Prior to each annual Expedition, students spent months working on projects to aid less privileged communities in the ASEAN region.
