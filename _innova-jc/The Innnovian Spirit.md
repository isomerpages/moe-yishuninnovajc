<center>The principal, Ms Yeo Hong Mui, welcomes the pioneer batch of Innovians.</center>

Innova Junior College welcomed its first batch of students on 3 January 2005 and Principal and staff were eager to embark on their mission to mould “champions of positive change”. The physical structure may have only been half-finished but the Innovian spirit was more than adequate to rise to the challenge. The staff and students worked around the ongoing construction and improvised where necessary so that programmes could continue. Civics groups painted over the unsightly temporary hoardings, beautifying them with images depicting their wishes for IJC. That dynamic, can-do spirit which was part of IJC’s genesis also catalysed its growth in subsequent years.
