Innova Junior College’s teachers’ professional competence and care for their students were invaluable to students’ learning as well as their emotional wellbeing and holistic development. The college emphasised the professional development of its teachers, with structured mentoring programmes for new teachers and sharing of best practices at staff development days. Teachers from IJC regularly shared effective pedagogical strategies and innovative practices at the cluster, zonal, national and international conferences. IJC’s teachers have won major professional awards and the college took particular pride in the genuine concern for students that inspired their professionalism.
