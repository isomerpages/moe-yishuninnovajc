<center>Student leaders take their pledge of leadership at the annual Student Leaders’ Investiture, which commemorates the start of their leadership journey.</center>

Innova Junior College focused on developing leaders with sound values, judgement and foresight. This development addressed 3 key leadership competencies encapsulated in a progressive Leadership Index: intellectual capacity, the ability to work in teams and drive. The top tier of student leaders comprised the Students’ Council and House Committees as well as the chaNgE.PACER Council which was set up in 2011 to develop empathetic leaders who advocated for communities in need. This core of IJC student leaders collaborated to be champions of positive change in IJC and the wider community.
