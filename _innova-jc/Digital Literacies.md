<center>Students enjoy collaborative learning in the Spaceroom, where they share ideas easily using portable whiteboards and iPads.</center>

The i@fun Carnival in 2008 to raise funds for an air-conditioned hall was part of Innova Junior Collegeâ€™s ongoing commitment to provide the best facilities for our students. Study carrels outside the Dance Studio and more seminar rooms for collaborative learning were subsequent improvements to create a more conducive learning environment. IJC kept in touch with the latest technological and educational trends in its quest to create a better studying environment for our students. The Spaceroom, launched by the ICT Committee in 2016, was a product of these efforts. It ushered in new ways of classroom teaching that combined ICT, collaborative learning, and interactive and consistent feedback.
