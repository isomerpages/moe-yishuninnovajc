Endorsed as the Centre of Excellence (COE) for New Media Arts in 2007, Innova Junior College empowered students with new media arts skills beneficial for higher education and their future careers. From its cutting-edge production studios to the biennial Finland Exchange Programme and film collaborations with non-profit organisations, the COE provided authentic learning opportunities for students. The COE expanded its focus to Digital Literacies in 2015, inspiring young coders, media artists and cyber wellness ambassadors to continue innovating and advocating at national platforms such as MakerFaire, the Cyber Wellness Student Ambassador Programme Conference and our signature Digital Insight workshop.
