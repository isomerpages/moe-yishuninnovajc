<br>To help you to make a more informed decision, the college has also created
a subject information guide. This information guide contains information
on subject eligibility, and provides a basic understanding of the subject
content and assessment requirements for the various A-level subjects. You
can access the guide via this link (<a href="https://for.edu.sg/yijcsubjectinfo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://for.edu.sg/yijcsubjectinfo</u></a>).</p>
<p>We encourage you to actively participate in these registration proceedings
to ensure a smooth transition into your chosen subjects. Should you have
any queries or require assistance, our dedicated staff will be more than
happy to help.</p>
<p>We look forward to supporting you in creating a tailored academic experience
at Yishun Innova Junior College.</p>
