<h3><strong>Football</strong></h3><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="450" width="800" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EelCovIef60"></iframe></div><p>Football is more than just a sport – it is The Beautiful Game. In YIJC Football, we celebrate the many virtues surrounding this beautiful game - sportsmanship, dedication, and teamwork. The pitch is our home, our battleground - the place that lights up the fire in us, the place where we forge brotherhood and memories. <br><br>We train twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Trainings are never dull: through a combination of training drills, mini games, and two-sided games, the training sessions are gruelling yet enjoyable. Through these sessions, our members unlock their potential as they push themselves to develop technically, mentally, tactically, and physically. The sweat and tears shed on the pitch only serves to deepen the bonds between teammates.<br><br>These sessions culminate in our yearly highlights: the National School Games ‘A’ Division Championship, as well as the competitive Inter-school friendly tournament in the lead-up to the Championship. <br><br>Few other sports bring people together in the same way, and we welcome you to join us on this journey with us. YIJC Football: a team above all, above all a team!</p>
