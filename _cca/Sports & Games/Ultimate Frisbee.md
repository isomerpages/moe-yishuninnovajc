Ultimate is a non-contact; self-refereed team sport. It is reliant on every player having the spirit of sportsmanship and respect for the game. In Discinfect, YIJC's Ultimate Frisbee team, we emphasise striving together as a team as well as embracing sportsmanship in every game that we play. While Ultimate Frisbee may be a leisure activity to some, to us it is a valuable competitive sport. It brings out the best in every player as it pushes everyone further, helps them challenge what they think they are capable of as well and also encourages holistic development.

We train twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays. The strenuous training challenges both our bodies and our willpower. But training in a group of unfamiliar faces, who quickly become a family we call our own, affirms the maxim that unity is strength. Our weekly drills, throwing practices and matches are vital in ensuring that we play to the best of our abilities and as one team.

As a CCA, our yearly highlight is the Inter-JC Ultimate Championship, which gives every player the invaluable experience of playing competitively. The annual intensive March training camp also helps to build strong friendships between our players. Within the college, we also get to plan an Advocacy Project and look forward to an Intra-CCA competition, where we pit our skills against each other to hone and improve our game strategies.

We seek those that will strive to give their best competitively, who have a positive attitude for constant self-improvement. Your journey in Discinfect is guaranteed to be a rollercoaster of struggles, frustrations, but with great heights of success. Through it all, you will stand together as a family who fights for each other, together as one.
