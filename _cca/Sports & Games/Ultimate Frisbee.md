<p>Ultimate is a non-contact; self-refereed team sport. It is reliant on
every player having the spirit of sportsmanship, and respect for the game.
In Discinfect, YIJC's Ultimate Frisbee team, we emphasise striving together
as a team as well as the value of sportsmanship in every game that we play.
While Ultimate Frisbee may be a leisure activity to some, to us it is also
a valuable competitive sport. It brings out the best in every player as
it pushes everyone further, helps them challenge what they think they are
capable of as well and also encourages holistic development.
<br>
<br>We train twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays. The strenuous training
challenges both our bodies and our willpower. But training in a group of
unfamiliar faces, who quickly become a family we call our own, affirms
the maxim that unity is strength. Our weekly drills, throwing practices
and matches are vital to ensure that we play to the best of our abilities
and as one team.
<br>
<br>As a CCA, our yearly highlight is the Inter-JC Ultimate Championship,
which gives every player the invaluable experience of playing competitively.
Within the college, members also get to plan and execute a Values-In-Action
project that engages the community.
<br>
<br>We seek those that will strive to give their best competitively, who have
a positive attitude for constant self-improvement. Your journey in Discinfect
is guaranteed to be a rollercoaster of struggles, frustrations, but with
great heights of success. Through it all, you will stand together as a
family who fights for one another, together as one.</p>
