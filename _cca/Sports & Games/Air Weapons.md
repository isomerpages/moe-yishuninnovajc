For prospective JC1 students, please note that the Air Weapons CCA will be closing in June 2023. For more information, you may enquire during the upcoming CCA fair.

Whether with a pistol or rifle, we are all about precision and tenacity. At YIJC, Air Weapons CCA seeks the holistic development of our members. We aim to develop leadership skills and inculcate strong values in the students. As a sports CCA, we not only train students in their physical strength, but develop their mental fortitude as well. To become a member of the Air Weapons club, one should have grit and patience - both essential qualities needed to master the different techniques in shooting. As the old adage goes - practice makes perfect, and perfect hits the bullâ€™s eye every time.  

We train twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays at SAFRA Yishun. All students in the CCA would need to clear the safety course organised by SAFRA before commencing training at SAFRA. We will hone our weapon handling skills and do firing practices. When we are close to the competition period, we also hold mock competition practices to gain experience and take stock of our current skill levels. Some CCA sessions will be held in college so that we can have team bonding activities, plan events or Values-in-Action (VIA) projects.

As an Air Weapons team member, you can gain invaluable experience in leading some of the CCA events such as VIA and team bonding activities. You also have the opportunity to represent the college at the National School Games and Invitational Shoots. Steady, Aim, Fire!
