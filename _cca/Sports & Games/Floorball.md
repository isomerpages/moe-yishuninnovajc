<p>In our team sport, success requires more than physical ability. Mental
resilience, teamwork, and strategic thinking are key to achieving peak
performance. At YIJC Floorball, we take pride in fostering a community
of passionate student-athletes who are dedicated to giving their best and
who strive to uphold the values of integrity and teamwork.</p>
<p>No prior experience with Floorball? Donâ€™t worry! Our structured training
sessions, held twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays, are designed to
help you build the necessary skills from the ground up. Members will also
receive feedback and guidance from our coaching experts. At YIJC Floorball,
what truly counts is your determination and perseverance.</p>
<p>YIJC Floorballers can look forward to participating in the annual National
School Games. Beyond the court, our members also engage in a range of student-led
college activities, including the CCA Values-in-Action programme and the
highly anticipated YIJC Open House. Join us and become part of the YIJC
Floorball family today!</p>
