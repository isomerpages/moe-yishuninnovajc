In a team sport such as ours, one needs more than just physical aptitude. Mental fortitude, teamwork and strategic thinking are essential for optimal performance. YIJC Floorball prides itself on being a CCA of student athletes who are passionate about the sport, committed to always doing their best and who strive to uphold the values of integrity and teamwork.

No prior knowledge or experience in Floorball? Fret not. Our rigorous twice-a-week training (Monday and Wednesday) under the guidance of our coaches will enable you to master the necessary skill work. In YIJC Floorball, what matters most is heart and grit.

With determination and enthusiasm, YIJC Floorballers train and compete in the annual National School Games! Other signature programmes that prospective floorballers can expect to participate in include the Intra Co-curricular Activity Games, where we pit our skills against one another to spur one another to greater heights.
