<p>Hey guys, have you heard of this saying? You Only Live Once, But You Get
To Serve Twice! Of course we are talking about Tennis! Tennis is a well-recognised
Olympic sport, played by people of all ages and backgrounds. It is known
for having millions of recreational players and being a popular worldwide
spectator sport. At YI Tennis, we aim to cultivate determined players with
quick-thinking minds, ready to put their best foot forward in the face
of any challenge.</p>
<p>Tennis is a sport where holding the racket is just the beginning, so regardless
of your prior experience, you are welcome to come join our family! We constantly
strive for excellence, aiming for the best in the yearly A-division competition.
Trainings are held twice a week, and the intensity may increase during
our competition period. During training sessions, we will guide you to
learn the rules of the game, giving you a chance to step outside your comfort
zone and stretch your potential to become a better player. You will also
be taught how to umpire a match. Other experiences you can look forward
to includes serving our community through member-led initiatives, competing
and cheering your teammates on in the annual National School Games!</p>
<p>If you choose tennis, we guarantee months of fun and friendships, while
you train to be a competitive player in this enjoyable sport. You can choose
to compete or simply play for the love of the game.</p>
