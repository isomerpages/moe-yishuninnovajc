Do you LOVE sports? Are you looking for a place to learn new sports? Look no further, as Modular Sports is the CCA for YOU! We are a CCA that helps to keep our members active through the thrill of playing various sports.

Some of the sports we play include:

*   Lawn Bowl (NEW!)
*   PÃ©tanque (NEW!)
*   Softball
*   Basketball
*   Frisbee
*   Volleyball
*   Tchoukball
*   Sports Education Programmes

Our CCA sessions are held twice a week and are 2.5 hours long. Members can look forward to practising with their teammates to learn a specific sport in each session/season. After around 5-7 sessions (a season), members will conduct a mini tournament where they would form teams to compete and test their skills. The CCA sessions are also planned and led by the CCA Exco.

Apart from learning a variety of sports, we also enable members to develop their leadership and communication skills through a multitude of student-led events such as the CCA showcase, CCA Exchange with other CCA groups and Values-In-Action (VIA) programmes. We also encourage student-led initiatives aligned with the CCA's Vision and Mission.

We have recently collaborated with National Sports Associations such as Bowls Singapore in conducting a Learn-to-Play Programme of Lawn Bowls (a recognised Commonwealth sport) for our members. Bowls Singapore will provide selected potential members with the opportunity to train under the National Development Squad (Juniors/under 25) and they may be provided with the opportunity to represent Singapore in the sport.

Sports help an individual much more than the physical aspects alone. It builds one's character, teaches and develops strategic and analytical thinking, leadership skills, goal setting and risk-taking, just to mention a few. So join us and come explore the world of Modular Sports!
