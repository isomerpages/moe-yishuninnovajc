<p>Passionate about sports? Eager to explore new athletic pursuits? Looking
to enhance your fitness level? Look no further than Modular Sports – the
ultimate CCA tailored just for YOU! We are dedicated to keeping our members
active and engaged through the exhilaration of participating in a diverse
range of sports. Our line-up includes exciting options like Pickleball,
alongside classics such as Softball, Basketball, Frisbee, Volleyball, and
Tchoukball. The CCA sessions are also designed to build your strength,
fitness, and skills across a variety of activities.</p>
<p>Our engaging CCA sessions take place twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays,
spanning 2 hours each. These sessions are meticulously planned and led
by the dedicated CCA Exco. Dive firsthand into the world of sports, practising
with your teammates to master a specific sport during each session or season.</p>
<p>But that's not all – beyond the sports arena, we provide opportunities
for personal development. Enhance your leadership and communication skills
through student-led events like the annual CCA showcase, exchanges with
other CCA groups, and participation in Values-In-Action (VIA) programs.
We actively encourage student-led initiatives aligned with the CCA's Vision
and Mission. In an exciting development, we have partnered with National
Sports Associations, such as Bowls Singapore, to bring you a Learn-to-Play
Programme for Lawn Bowls, a recognized Commonwealth sport. Selected members
may even have the chance to train under the National Development Squad
(Juniors/under 25) and represent Singapore in this prestigious sport.</p>
<p>Sports are more than just a physical activity; they shape character and
foster strategic thinking, leadership skills, goal-setting, and risk-taking.
We invite you to explore the world of Modular Sports, where passion meets
purpose!</p>
