In Basketball, various physical attributes are essential, such as speed, stamina, strength, good hand-eye coordination, agility, and accuracy. Moreover, as a team sport, mental aspects such as tactics and strategies also play an important role in Basketball. Through trainings and games, positive values such as teamwork, sportsmanship, integrity and respect are instilled in our members. Regardless of the outcome or results, we maintain the utmost respect for our teachers, coaches, teammates, referees and opponents.

During our weekly training sessions on Wednesday and Friday, we usually begin with warm-up exercises, then proceed to practise drills and tactics to develop the physical and mental aspects of our game. Our coaches and teachers are always there to look after us and give timely feedback and suggestions to improve our game.

Some of our CCA highlights include an annual CCA Exchange Programme, the chance to execute and plan an advocacy project, and most importantly the National School Games ‘A’ Division Championships. We also organise the Intra-Basketball Games, where we pit our skills and wit against one another for top honours. Our Basketball players forge strong bonds, motivate and help each other. So come and join us!
