Badminton is an international sport recognised by the whole world. At Yishun Innova Junior College, Badminton is not just any ordinary competitive sport, but a sport that requires you to be mentally prepared for any challenges. It is a sport that forges strong bonds between players.

We train twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays and step up the intensity during the competition period. Training is in the college and occasionally in Yishun or Yio Chu Kang Sports Hall. Our training sessions usually include fitness training, skill-based drills, friendly matches between players and much sagely advice from our coach on how to improve our game and our fitness. We are looking for potential players who are physically and mentally prepared to train hard and do their best in every game. Whether you have prior experience or not, it does not matter. In Badminton, we believe that if there’s a will, there’s a way. If you choose to join us, you can forge strong friendships with other players, motivate each other to train hard and also build trust in each other.

Our annual CCA highlights include friendly matches with other JCs, CCA Values-in-Action projects, our college CCA Exchange Programme, and Open House, and most importantly, our participation in the National School Games A Division Badminton Championships. The A Division National Championships truly gives us a chance to test our skills after countless strenuous and vigorous training sessions and helps the team bond as one family. So what are you waiting for? Come and join our CCA today!
