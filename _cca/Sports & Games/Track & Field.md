In YIJC Track and Field, we work as a team to reach our fullest potential. Our CCA moulds our members into determined and resilient individuals who push themselves to overcome limits, to emerge as stronger and better athletes.

Weekly trainings take place every Wednesday and Friday afternoon from 4.30 - 6.30pm. Build your resilience, stamina and skills through training sessions consisting of warm-up exercises, drills and work-outs that are customised to meet the needs of student athletes.

Members will also have the opportunity to take part in a variety of student-led college events like the CCA Values-in-Action programme, Intra-CCA competitions, YIJC Open House, as well as inter-college competitions such as the Virtual Inter-school Mileage Challenge and the National School Games (Cross-Country and Track and Field A-Division). Our 2021-2022 batch of runners managed to qualify for the finals of 4 different events such as the 100m, 200m, 4x100m and 4x400m sprints for the male category. Our members put in their utmost efforts to strive for excellence. With the newly eased Covid 19 situations, the sport will open up to many more different opportunities to show one's potential. Join us for an unforgettable journey of fun and self-discovery!

You are who you choose to be. Run, to be the best version of yourself!
