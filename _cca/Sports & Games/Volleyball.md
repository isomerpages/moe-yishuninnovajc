<p>In YIJC Volleyball, we focus on sports excellence and the spirit of friendship,
teamwork and fair play. Every member would have the opportunity to hone
their skills, develop a greater level of sportsmanship and build strong
character. We also provide numerous opportunities for students to develop
themselves in their leadership competencies.
<br>
<br>We train outdoors twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays, two hours per
session. Each session usually comprises skills-based drills, formation
tactics and fitness training. We welcome everyone to join us at YIJC Volleyball,
be it newbies who are interested to pick up the sport, or students with
prior experience who want to improve your skills.
<br>
<br>At YIJC Volleyball, members can look forward to participating in various
significant events, both within the college and externally, such as the
annual National School Games Volleyball Championships, HICAPE Advocacy
Projects, CCA Exchange Programme, Intra-Volleyball games and et cetera.
These events help to hone the technical skills of our Volleyball members
and also develop them in the area of values and care for the community.

<br><em>â€œVolleyball is one of the most interactive sports going. It is a game of intuition. Imagination. Improvisation. But most of all, of reciprocity. Of teamwork."</em> -
