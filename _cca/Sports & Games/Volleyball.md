In YIJC Volleyball, we focus on sports excellence and the spirit of friendship, teamwork and fair play. Every member would be able to hone their skills, develop a greater level of sportsmanship and build strong character. We also provide numerous opportunities for students to develop themselves in their leadership competencies.

We train outdoors twice a week, two hours per session. Each training session usually comprises skills-based drills, formation tactics and fitness training. We welcome everyone to join us at YIJC Volleyball, be it newbies who are interested to pick up the sport, or students with prior experience who want to improve your skills.

At YIJC Volleyball, members can look forward to participating in various significant events, both within the college and externally, such as the annual National School Games Volleyball Championships, HICAPE Advocacy Projects, CCA Exchange Programme, Intra-Volleyball games and et cetera. These events help to hone the technical skills of our Volleyball members and also develop them in the area of values and care for the community.

_“Volleyball is one of the most interactive sports going. It is a game of intuition. Imagination. Improvisation. But most of all, of reciprocity. Of teamwork."_ \- Marv Dunphy
