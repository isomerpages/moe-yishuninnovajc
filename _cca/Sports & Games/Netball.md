Netball is a team sport exclusive to girls with seven players per side passing a ball, aiming to shoot in a designated shooting area with strict positional rules and restrictions. 

Train your skills and try out different positions in attack, defense or as a shooter! Have no experience? Do not worry, as you can pick up and hone your skills with us weekly on Mondays and Fridays from 5.15pm - 7.15pm. 

Apart from competing in the annual National School Games, as Netballers, you will have the opportunity to develop your leadership qualities through various projects throughout the year. You can also look forward to building strong bonds and making connections within the team. 

At YI Netball, we work as a team to overcome setbacks and challenges together. We believe that these difficulties only make us stronger and more resilient. So come join us for a game of Netball!
