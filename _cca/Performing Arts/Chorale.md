YIJC Chorale is a place where each and every individual is a valued member of a larger harmonious whole. It is a place where students are nurtured to develop their confidence, discipline and their ability to work in a team; and where they emerge stronger mentally, emotionally and physically. All singers are encouraged to strive for excellence and to enjoy the journey along the way. Through the regular rhythm of our CCA sessions, singers will grow their passion for music and the aesthetics through vocal masterclasses and acapella workshops.

Our training session takes place twice a week, usually on Wednesdays and Fridays. In each training session, our members can look forward to honing their singing skills within their sectional group or as a whole chorale group, under the patient guidance of our instructor.

We believe in the importance of holistic development. Besides performing in concerts like our biennial Arts Fusion Concert and participating in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, YIJC Chorale also provide opportunities for our students to give back to the community. This includes coming up with Values-In-Action project where students can contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills.

A choir is a symphony of many voices and we hope that you will choose to add yours to ours. We look forward to welcoming you into our Chorale family!
