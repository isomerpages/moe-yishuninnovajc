<p>Do you love to sing, but only do so in the shower? Do you have a secret
flair for the electric guitar or the drums? Or perhaps the knack for setting
up equipment for a band? If any of these describes you, Musicians’ Club
(MC) may be the best platform for you.</p>
<p>In YI MC, members are recruited for their ability to sing, play the electric
guitar, bass guitar, drums, or keys. United by their ability to perform,
but more importantly, their passion for music, members form small bands
within the CCA, each with their unique flavour and blend of music.</p>
<p>We have about 10 bands across both levels, and each band practises with
our instructor for an hour, before practising on their own for another
hour. Each band comes for 2 hours of CCA each week on either Wednesday
or Friday. The respective bands are then rostered for the many performance
opportunities each year, ranging from College Day to Teachers Day.</p>
<p>All bands also work towards increasing their song repertoire for our biggest
event – LISTEN. Our annual concert LISTEN invites hundreds of students,
family members and friends to enjoy an exciting evening of songs from various
genres, and MC members take full responsibility in planning and executing
the concert. We bring in a professional technical crew to help us with
our sound and lights, while our members focus on stage management and performing.
Beyond LISTEN, through collaboration within bands and with other bands,
members are self-driven to improve their technique and musicality. The
strong passion for music has even led to some of our alumni pursuing further
education and a career in music-related fields.</p>
<p>If you have PA or AVA experience AND wish to learn to play an instrument
before eventually playing in a band, do feel free to speak to us too. We
look forward to meeting you!</p>
