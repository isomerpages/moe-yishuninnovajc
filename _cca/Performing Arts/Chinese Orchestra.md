Have you ever seen a Chinese Orchestra performing renowned hits such as Despacito and Havana? YIJC CO is definitely not your typical Orchestra! We play a myriad of songs ranging from upbeat Western chart-toppers to soothing Chinese movie soundtracks like 凉凉 from 三生三世十里桃花 (Eternal Love) and 那些年 from 那些年我们一起追的女孩 (You are the Apple of my Eye).

Our vision is for members to develop a deeper interest and appreciation of Chinese music. Everyone will be given an equal opportunity to perform and be recognised as a leader. More importantly, the CCA also allows members to build confidence through performing and develop a sense of responsibility and resilience when learning something completely foreign to us.

YIJC CO is a close knit community - we are one big family, including conductors and teachers. With a shared vision, we practice hard twice a week, striving to show our best to the audience, just like the famous chinese saying : 台上一分钟，台下十年功 (For one minute of performance on the stage, ten years of hard work is required offstage). Our CCA days and timings are as follow: (1) Every Wednesday 4.30pm to 7.30pm for combined practice and every Friday 5.15pm to 7.30pm for sectionals.

A typical CCA session comprises the following: (a) Venue and instrument setup, (b) Warm up, (c) Review of melodies with the Conductor and/or Sectional instructors and (d) Debrief by Conductor / Sectional instructors, Teachers in-charge and/or Student Leaders.

Our annual highlights include participation in the Singapore Youth Arts Festival as well as Arts Fusion. Arts Fusion is a biennial celebration of the arts held in the college. Members also have the opportunity to perform in school events such as the Lunar New Year Celebrations and College Day. Members also participate in self-initiated Values-in-Action/Advocacy projects to develop the value of humanity - learning how to show care, empathy and compassion for others in the community.
