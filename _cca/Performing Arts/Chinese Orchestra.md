Regular CCA Session Overview: 
* Wednesday Sessions: - Wednesday sessions are dedicated to combined practice under the guidance of our renowned conductor, Mr. Low Cher Yong. It's a time when the entire orchestra comes together to create beautiful music as one harmonious ensemble. Beyond music, students use this time for discussions related to leadership assignments and Values-in-Action (VIA) projects. 

* Friday Sessions: - Fridays are all about sectional practice, where students receive specialized instruction from our talented sectional instructors. Each section of the orchestra is led by a dedicated tutor:  Mdm. Yan Yu for the pluckstring section; Ms. Janice Chua for the woodwind section; Ms. Guo Suwen for the cello and double bass section and Mr. Low Cher Yong for the Huqin and percussion section - These sessions allow students to refine their skills, technique, and musicality within their specific sections. 

YIJC CO offers a comprehensive CCA experience where students not only hone their musical talents but also build essential life skills, create lasting friendships, and make a difference in the community. Join us on this harmonious journey!
