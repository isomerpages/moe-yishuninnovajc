YI Dance places great emphasis on the three fundamental elements of a good dancer: passion, attitude and perseverance. We believe that to be a good dancer, you need not necessarily have perfect techniques or good musicality, but it is your dedication and commitment to improve that defines you as a YI Dancer. 

For us, dance sessions are essentially a safe space for all dancers to escape, free their minds and let their creativity flow. In this safe space, we focus on helping one another improve, and motivate each other to push through when we get tired. In this aspect, YI Dance is more than a CCA, we are a team, and a family. YI Dance is where dancers can grow and develop beyond any one particular genre of dance, and where dancers are encouraged to strive to be the best performers they can be. 

Our CCA sessions are held twice a week, usually on Wednesday and Friday. Extra practices are held at times, especially when key performances come up. The training session will usually begin with warm-up exercises and conditioning, or other exercises for physical conditioning and stamina training. These physical training aspects are important for all dancers. Following that, the dance instructor will help to train basic dance techniques and run through choreography. 

With every session, we learn more than just another dance technique or choreography. We learn important values and lessons which we do not get from the textbooks. In 2024, we look forward to develop such values and skills through Arts Fusion, YIJC College Day performance, and external performance opportunities as and when they are available. We continue to push our boundaries through exploring various choreographies. We also use dance to reach out to the community, advocating causes that we believe in. 

In YI Dance, it does not matter if you were a contemporary dancer or a hip hop dancer. Here, we all aspire to grow together and learn from one another! Join us with an open mind and an open heart. Our passion for dance connects us all and this is captured fittingly in our rally call - this is the reason, Y I Dance!
