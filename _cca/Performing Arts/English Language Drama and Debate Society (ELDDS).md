YIJC's Drama Club and the Debate Society have merged to form English Language Drama and Debate Society. Students can choose to indicate their preference on whether they prefer to be part of the Drama or Debating section. For us at ELDDS (Drama), the stage is a magical place. You get to live countless lives, tell important stories, and reap experiences that will last a lifetime. In 2022, despite the challenges of the pandemic, we managed to return to the stage and perform for the Singapore Youth Festival 2022. The 2022 play, entitled "Four Daughters", focused on family and mother-daughter relationships. We received the Certificate of Accomplishment for our efforts. All the world's a stage, so come and experience it with us here at ELDDS (Drama).

ELDDS (Debate) aims to provide experiences that are conducive to developing one's cognitive and presentational skills. Our debate experiences have allowed our members to acquire unique debate skills far beyond what can be learnt in any other setting. Our members continue to execute the power of deploying rational, reasoned arguments and compelling evidence in our online actions. This enables us to elucidate our standpoint through rhetorical eloquence on a virtual platform. Participating in Debate has advantaged our students to expand their network and build friendships with other colleges and institutions from around the world. Our YIJC debaters continue to inspire us with great poise and confidence in the Debate Arena!

Our members are engaged throughout the year, and they can look forward to meeting like-minded peers at several tournaments and honing their skills through our annual CCA highlights, not limited to those below:
*   NUS Political Association Debate Series (NUSPA)
*   International Oldham Cup Debating Competition
*   MOE Intercollegiate Debating Championships
