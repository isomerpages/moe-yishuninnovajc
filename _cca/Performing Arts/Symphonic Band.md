The YIJC Symphonic Band is a family where different sounds come in to make music together. It comprises three sections: Woodwinds, Brass and Percussion. Each section and member has a unique role to play in the band. The melody of the music is mainly carried by the flutes and clarinets. The tuba and trombone take charge of the bass of the music, which is the “backbone” of the music, and the percussion keeps everyone on time. Smooth coordination allow band members to play a beautiful music piece together.

Our CCA sessions are held twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays. Extra practices may be held at times, prior to key performances such as Arts Fusion as well as the Singapore Youth Festival Arts (SYF) Presentation. A typical CCA session comprises the following: (a) Venue and instrument setup, (b) Warm up, (c) Review of music pieces with Conductor and/or Sectional instructors and (d) Debrief by the Conductor / Sectional instructors, Teachers in-charge and/or Student Leaders. During our regular band practice, we have sectionals and full band rehearsals. During sectionals, members will work on their individual parts before playing as a section, giving them time to work on the details in the pieces and to familiarise themselves with the different parts within their section. Full band rehearsals then allow members to play the pieces together under the baton of our (student) conductor, exposing members to the different parts that other instruments are playing. The different sections have to work well together for the music to sound melodious and to bring out the message of the music piece.

YIJC Symphonic Band participates in SYF and also our college’s biennial Arts Fusion Concert to celebrate the arts in school. These events give us the opportunity to showcase our talents and expose more people to band music. We also provide our members with opportunities to give back to the community through student-initiated Values in Action (VIA) or Advocacy projects for a cause that they believe that will benefit society.

YIJC Symphonic Band is a place where students can forge great memories, friendship, and even hone their leadership skills. We want to fill the world with music in an attempt to heal the hearts and minds of people around us.
