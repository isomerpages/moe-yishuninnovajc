The Culture & Aesthetic Club (CAS) is an inter-cultural club that focuses on instilling a greater love for Mother Tongue languages through cultural and literary-based programmes, activities and competitions. CAS is a unique CCA where members possess a strong passion for upholding and integrating Singaporean culture and literature, working collaboratively on drama and dance performances, Values-In-Action (VIA) projects as well as other signature programmes such as the Pre-University Seminar. In our training sessions,we focus on developing students' leadership and communication skills through various language and literary activities. Our signature programmes are also part of the college's tradition.

Our training session takes place twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays from 4.30 pm to 6.30 pm.
