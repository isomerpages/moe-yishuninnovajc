<p>For us at the English Drama Society, the stage is a heterotopia of magic.
You get to live countless lives, tell important stories, and reap experiences
that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Our CCA sessions are held twice a week, usually on Wednesdays and Fridays.
Members can look forward to developing their creativity, being part of
different artistic works and also performing at different events and spaces.</p>
<p>In 2024, the Drama Society presented 'Looking Down': an original and potent
critique of the parasocial relationships we enter into with social media,
at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, attaining a Certficate
of Accomplishment to both rapturous applause and plaudits that were expressed
in superlative terms.</p>
<p>In 2025, members of the Drama Society will bring their talents, flair
and biting wit to the stage for our biennial Arts Fusion Performance.</p>
