<p>With a deep focus on digital literacies and the related technological
competencies, Makers’ Academy provides an avenue for students to experiment
with cutting-edge technologies to hone their media, computational and innovation
skills.</p>
<p>Members have a choice between three departments (PFM, iMAD and ADU), each
with their unique way of exercising their digital creativity. Sessions
are held twice weekly on Wednesdays and Fridays from 4:30pm to 6:30pm.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>In Photography and Film-making department (PFM) -</strong> we learn
various photography techniques and share our photographs which is a good
opportunity to learn from each other, and a platform for us to practise
our public speaking skills. The film-making aspect requires us to work
in teams, honing our interpersonal skills while providing the space for
us to generate ideas. PFM members will get to cover college events and
also have join competitions such as Canon Youth Photography Awards and
‘Our Schools, Our Stories’ photo contest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In Interactive Making and Design (iMAD) </strong>- we focus on
designing projects of various complexity using the Arduino microcontroller.
To succeed in these projects, teams require skill in design, programming,
electronics and even 3D printing. With our external partners, we offer
opportunities for members to explore drone programming and robotics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In App Development Unit (ADU)</strong> - our members come together
and create something transformative. This unit mainly focuses on learning
the fundamentals of programming, a quintessential skill of the 21st century.
We then apply these in game and web development and other exciting projects.
Through external workshops, members are offered opportunities to solve
problems in cybersecurity, data science and machine learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This year-long programme culminates in a final project where students
can apply their skills in addressing a problem they care deeply for. With
these different departments and carefully curated programmes and CCA sessions,
we aim to bring out the best in each member while providing a fun and enriching
experience.</p>
