The YIJC Students’ Council is the highest tier in the college's student leadership group. Our aim is to promote a positive college culture and galvanise a strong sense of affiliation to the college among students. The Students’ Council uses the Assignments, Relationships and Courses (ARC) approach to develop our student leaders under the guidance of the teachers.

Our meetings are held twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays, from 4.30pm to 6.30pm, and it is a time where our Councillors would come together to plan their projects and build stronger camaraderie. Councillors will be able to work closely with one another in different groups for various projects across the two years. The Students' Council also holds an annual camp in April where Councillors can further develop their leadership competencies.

Key college events such as the JC1 Orientation, Student Leaders' Investiture and Teachers' Day are organised and executed by the Students' Council. Councillors are given the space to propose and implement their own initiatives that contribute meaningfully to our school community. The invaluable experience offered by the Students' Council gives our student leaders an edge in their future, as they punch above their weight to lead the whole college to greater heights.
