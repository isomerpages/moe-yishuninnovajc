<p>Do you have a passion for helping others? If so, Yishun Innova Junior
College’s Interact Club might be the CCA for you. We seek compassionate,
committed team players who are eager to make a difference. Guided by our
motto, ‘Service Above Self’, we plan and organise volunteer work that supports
the community and fosters empathy for people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Interact Club meets twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays, from 4.30pm
to 6.30pm. During CCA sessions, members collaborate on various Values-In-Action
(VIA) projects, either planning ongoing initiatives or proposing new ones
based on community needs. These opportunities help members develop leadership,
teamwork and interpersonal skills while building stronger friendships.
We also organise team-building games to strengthen camaraderie.</p>
