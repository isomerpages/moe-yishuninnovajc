<p>Welcome to The Art Club, a place where imagination knows no bounds! More
than just a space for developing our artistic skills, weâ€™re a close-knit
community of passionate individuals who share a love for the arts. Here,
creativity thrives through collaboration and mutual support, as we believe
that together, we can achieve something truly remarkable. Every brushstroke,
musical note, and splash of color becomes part of a collective journey
of artistic growth and discovery.</p>
<p>The Art Club meets twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays, from 4:30
to 6:30 pm. Guided by a philosophy of student leadership, our CCA sessions
are primarily student-driven. Club members have the opportunity to explore
a wide range of artistic mediums, from linocut and clay work to landscape
sketching and even mosaic art. In addition to creating, students share
their artworks with peers, honing their ability to communicate the ideas
and inspiration behind their pieces.</p>
<p>To enrich our artistic journey, we also engage in impactful VIA (Values
In Action) projects annually. One such recent initiative saw us advocating
for the Cat Welfare Society, raising awareness of the need for stronger
animal welfare and supporting their cause. To connect effectively with
the college community, we organised a games and art booth, offering a fun
and interactive way to spread our message. Looking back, we cherish the
memories, experiences, and insights gained from these projects, as they
continue to inspire and fuel our creative pursuits. Come join us if you
share a passion for the arts!</p>
