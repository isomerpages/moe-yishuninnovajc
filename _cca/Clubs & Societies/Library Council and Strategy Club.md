Starting 2023, YIJC's Library Council and Strategy Club have merged. Students who join will be exposed and developed in both areas, enjoying the best of both CCAs.

The Library Council holds two CCA sessions a week where students are involved in hands-on activities such as preparing events to publicise the college library resources as well as conducting research to further their own academic knowledge. Students also learn about the workings of the library by taking responsibility for managing the various resources that the library has to offer, such as books, files and electronic resources.

Strategy Club trains twice a week. The regular session includes a warm up game, basic drills and a competitive game. The guided session is conducted by a certified coach who will teach the club members various strategies of international chess. Besides international chess, students will also have the opportunitity to learn how to play various boardgames and transfer and apply the strategies learnt from chess to other modes of strategy games.

Synergising what both CCAs do, prospective members can participate in the activities offered by both the Library Council and Strategy Club, developing research and resource management skills and putting them into good use to level up their capacity and performance in different strategy games.
