<p>The English Debate Society aims to grow membersâ€™ cognitive and presentational
skills. Our curated debate experiences have allowed members to acquire
unique debate skills far beyond what can be learnt in any other setting,
and to grow in their critical thinking, confidence, and leadership capabilities.</p>
<p>Our CCA sessions are held twice a week, usually on Wednesdays and Fridays.
During these sessions, members are trained in their speaking skills and
engage in regular sparring sessions to hone their speaking competencies.</p>
<p>In 2024, our YIJC debaters participated in various competitions such as
the MIDC-ACJC Intercollegiate Debating Championships 2024, the MIDs 2024
Debating Competition, the 10th Oldham International, as well as a number
of other competitions with other junior colleges. This has helped expand
their network and also allowed them to build friendships with peers from
differing backgrounds. In 2025, the English Debate Society plans to continue
engaging in various competitions so as to cement the college's place in
the Debate ecosystem in Singapore.</p>
