Starting 2023, YIJC's Art Club and the Guitar Ensemble have merged. However, for prospective JC1 students, do note that YIJC Guitar will be closing in June 2023 and will not be taking in new members this year. The Art Club will still be taking in new CCA members this year.

CCA sessions are held twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays, from 4.30 to 6.30pm.

The YIJC Art Club aims to be inclusive in creating, appreciating and sharing art. It is a place where we hone our skills, develop our techniques, collaborate and bond with our friends, all in an environment that is designed for us to explore the arts in a supportive and encouraging setting. It is a space free from negativity and we focus only on the positive attributes that can help us contribute to the club. During the CCA sessions, students engage in the process of creating a variety of art forms which includes linocut, clay and landscape sketching. Students will also have the opportunity to participate in workshops such as Batik Printing and Manga Drawing to further cultivate their aesthetic appreciation.

Some of the activities that we were involved in includes YIJC Art Exhibition, Arts Fusion and Learning Journeys. Through these activities, students get to showcase their Art works to their peers and also hone their communication skills as they share their thoughts from drawing the art pieces. Additionally, students are also encouraged to participate in Art competitions or activities which can further expand their views on the different art themes.
