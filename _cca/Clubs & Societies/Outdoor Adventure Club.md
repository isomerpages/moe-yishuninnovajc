<p>Do you wish to grow physically and mentally stronger? Are you someone
who enjoys challenging yourself to grow? In the Outdoor Adventure Club
(ODAC), you can look forward to exciting activities that will push you
past your comfort zone into uncharted territories. This CCA serves to be
a platform where you can discover existing and new strengths, challenge
your limits and reach your greatest potential. You will get the chance
to learn from new experiences and also enjoy the camaraderie as you and
your fellow members in ODAC conquer various challenges together, echoing
our motto: ‘One ODAC One Family’.</p>
<p>Our CCA sessions are held twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays, usually
from 4.30 to 6.30pm. These include physical training sessions that serve
to increase the general fitness levels of our members, to better prepare
them for fun and adventurous activities in different outdoor settings.
Members will also have the opportunity to learn basic outdoor skills such
as knot tying and basic navigation, attend a first aid certification course
and have the opportunity to apply their knowledge of these skills to different
situations and build their capacity for better critical thinking.</p>
<p>Some of our key highlights include participating in an annual year-end
camp in Pulau Ubin (subject to availability) – where members can look forward
to applying the skills that they have learnt and also enjoy the great outdoors.
If the idea of adventure gets your adrenaline pumping, this is the ideal
CCA for you. Come join our ODAC family!</p>
