<p>Are you passionate about building meaningful relationships, learning new
skills, and making a positive impact on your school community? The Class
Leaders’ Council (CLC) at YIJC offers a supportive platform to develop
your leadership skills while fostering a culture of care among peers. The
CLC equips Class Leaders with skills to navigate various challenges such
as adapting to school life, building friendships and managing examinations,
all while contributing to a vibrant and compassionate college environment.
Through formal assignments, leadership courses, and mentorship, Class Leaders
grow as individuals and learn how to uplift their peers.</p>
<p>We meet twice weekly, on Wednesdays and Fridays, from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30
p.m. During these sessions, Class Leaders will be trained in designing
class activities, collaborating with other student leaders, and applying
positive coping strategies. These skills enable them to support their classmates
effectively and advocate for healthy, meaningful relationships in the college.</p>
<p>Additionally, CLC members play a key role in shaping college initiatives
such as Thrive!, our signature Mental Well-Being Week. They facilitate
discussions, provide practical and emotional support to peers, and implement
ideas that promote a positive and inclusive class spirit. Joining the CLC
means becoming part of a team dedicated to enhancing the well-being and
resilience of our college community. If you are empathetic, encouraging,
and enthusiastic about making a difference, the Class Leaders’ Council
is the place for you!</p>
